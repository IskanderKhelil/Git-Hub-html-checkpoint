      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        At B4C Solutions, We are a group of professionals committed to a shared
        vision of promoting quality, respect, honesty, and trust. This enables
        us to create exceptional products while building strong relational bonds
        with our customers. Our methodology is a mix and match of the Agile and
        SDLC methodologies and is adapted to suit the client's needs. Whilst the
        scope definition and progress reporting to the client falls mainly in
        the SDLC arena, the development environment is dominated by the Agile
        process, with 2-week sprints and iterative builds of working components,
        being at the core of our delivery. And this has been going on with us
        since 2019, So our history is there to back up these claims!

      <p>
        WE BELIEVE IN YOUR IMPLICATION! yes. And we really mean it ! Here at B4C
        Solutions, we know that a product's cost is 15% lower when the customer
        is involved in the development process, reducing all unnecessary effort
        introduced by misunderstandings, we call this the Cost of Missing
        Business, it is why we value your feedback, and we want our role here to
        not simply execute a set of your requirements and deliver an output, but
        to help you make your vision come true. We are building this product
        together, and without your contribution, the result will not have the
        same value, it is the reason why we make sure to include our customers
        in every stage of the development process, from initial research to the
        support phase, you will always be there, and we will make sure that the
        product always adheres to your expectations.
